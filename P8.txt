Aim: Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from the user and generates a list and a tuple with those numbers.

Source code:
print('Enter comma-separated numbers: ',end='')
nlist = [int(i) for i in input().split(',')]
ntup = tuple(nlist)
print(f'List of Numbers: {nlist}')
print(f'Tuple of Numbers: {ntup}')


OUTPUT 

Enter comma-separated numbers: 10,20,30,40,50
List of Numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Tuple of Numbers: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
