Aim: To accept a list of N integers and partition list into two sublists of even and odd numbers.

Source code:
print('Enter List Elements: ',end='')
numl = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
even = [i for i in numl if i%2==0]
odd = [i for i in numl if i%2!=0]

print(f'Original List: {numl}')
print(f'Even Number List: {even}')
print(f'Odd Number List: {odd}')



OUTPUT 

Enter List Elements: 5 3 8 6 9 71
Original List: [5, 3, 8, 6, 9, 71]
Even Number List: [8, 6]
Odd Number List: [5, 3, 9, 71]
